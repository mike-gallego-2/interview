# Book demo

This project fetches a local db, and maps the values to output an array of Books. You can Add, Edit, and Delete a record. This project utilizes the BLoC state management and it is to show how the architecture works and acts as a guide for developers to work off of. This also shows the usage of RxDart, where an extension of the package sqflite is able to be listened to, and provide updates to the bloc event, and have it reflect on the UI.
